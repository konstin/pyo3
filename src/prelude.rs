//! A collection of items you most likely want to have in scope when working with pyo3
//!
//! The purpose of this module is to alleviate imports of many common pyo3 traits
//! by adding a glob import to the top of pyo3 heavy modules:
//!
//! ```
//! # #![allow(unused_imports)]
//! use pyo3::prelude::*;
//! ```
