## [Unreleased]

### Removed

 * `PyToken` was removed due to unsoundness (See [#94](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/issues/94)).

## [0.5.0] - 2018-11-11

### Added

 * `#[pyclass]` objects can now be returned from rust functions
 * `PyComplex` by kngwyu in [#226](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/226)
 * `PyDict::from_sequence()`, equivalent to `dict([(key, val), ...])`
 * Bindings for the `datetime` standard library types: `PyDate`, `PyTime`, `PyDateTime`, `PyTzInfo`, `PyDelta` with associated `ffi` types, by pganssle [#200](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/200).
 * `PyString`, `PyUnicode`, and `PyBytes` now have an `as_bytes()` method that returns `&[u8]`.
 * `PyObjectProtocol::get_type_ptr()` by ijl in [#242](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/242)

### Removed
 * Removed most entries from the prelude. The new prelude is small and clear.
 * Slowly removing specialization uses
 * `PyString`, `PyUnicode`, and `PyBytes` no longer have a `data()` method
 (replaced by `as_bytes()`) and `PyStringData` has been removed.
 * The pyobject_extract macro

### Changed
 * Removes the types from the root module and the prelude. They now live in `pyo3::types` instead.
 * All exceptions are consturcted with `py_err` instead of `new`, as they return `PyErr` and not `Self`.
 * `as_mut` and friends take and `&mut self` instead of `&self`
 * `ObjectProtocol::call` now takes an `Option<&PyDict>` for the kwargs instead of an `IntoPyDictPointer`.
 * `IntoPyDictPointer` was replace by `IntoPyDict` which doesn't convert `PyDict` itself anymore and returns a `PyDict` instead of `*mut PyObject`.
 * `PyTuple::new` now takes an `IntoIterator` instead of a slice
 * Updated to syn 0.15
 * Splitted `PyTypeObject` into `PyTypeObject` without the create method and `PyTypeCreate` with requires `PyObjectAlloc<Self> + PyTypeInfo + Sized`.
 * Ran `cargo edition --fix` which prefixed path with `crate::` for rust 2018
 * Renamed `async` to `pyasync` as async will be a keyword in the 2018 edition.
 * Starting to use `NonNull<*mut PyObject>` for Py and PyObject by ijl [#260](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/260)

### Fixed

 * Added an explanation that the GIL can temporarily be released even while holding a GILGuard.
 * Lots of clippy errors
 * Fix segfault on calling an unknown method on a PyObject
 * Work around a [bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/55380) in the rust compiler by kngwyu [#252](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/252)
 * Fixed a segfault with subclassing pyo3 create classes and using `__class__` by kngwyu [#263](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/263)

## [0.4.1] - 2018-08-20

### Fixed

 * Fixed compilation on nightly since `use_extern_macros` was stabilized

### Changed

 * PyTryFrom's error is always to `PyDowncastError`

### Removed

 * The pyobject_downcast macro

## [0.4.0] - 2018-07-30

### Removed

 * Conversions from tuples to PyDict due to [rust-lang/rust#52050](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/52050)

### Changed

 * Merged both examples into one
 * Rustfmt all the things :heavy_check_mark:
 * Switched to [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## [0.3.2] - 2018-07-22

### Changed

* Replaced `concat_idents` with mashup

## [0.3.1] - 2018-07-18

### Fixed

* Fixed scoping bug in pyobject_native_type that would break rust-numpy

## [0.3.0] - 2018-07-18

### Changed

* Upgraded to syn 0.14 which means much better error messages :tada:
* 128 bit integer support by [kngwyu](https://github.com/kngwyu) ([#137](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/173))
* `proc_macro` has been stabilized on nightly ([rust-lang/rust#52081](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/52081)). This means that we can remove the `proc_macro` feature, but now we need the `use_extern_macros` from the 2018 edition instead.
* All proc macro are now prefixed with `py` and live in the prelude. This means you can use `#[pyclass]`, `#[pymethods]`, `#[pyproto]`, `#[pyfunction]` and `#[pymodinit]` directly, at least after a `use pyo3::prelude::*`. They were also moved into a module called `proc_macro`. You shouldn't use `#[pyo3::proc_macro::pyclass]` or other longer paths in attributes because `proc_macro_path_invoc` isn't going to be stabilized soon.
* Renamed the `base` option in the `pyclass` macro to `extends`.
* `#[pymodinit]` uses the function name as module name, unless the name is overrriden with `#[pymodinit(name)]`
* The guide is now properly versioned.

### Added

* A few internal macros became part of the public api ([#155](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/155), [#186](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3/pull/186))
* Always clone in getters. This allows using the get-annotation on all Clone-Types
